         <h3>The French Drop</h3>

      </div>
      <div id="steps">
         <ol>
            <li><strong>Display the coin</strong><br>
               Hold the coin at your fingertips in your left hand, between the thumb and fingers so everyone can clearly see it.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Approach with the other hand</strong><br>
               Bring your right hand over the coin as if you are going to take it.
               The right thumb goes on one side of the coin, the right fingers on the other.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>The secret move</strong><br>
               As the right hand appears to take the coin, relax the left thumb slightly.
               The coin drops into the left palm, hidden by your fingers.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Sell the illusion</strong><br>
               Close your right hand as if it is holding the coin.
               At the same time, let your left hand relax naturally.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Misdirection</strong><br>
               Look at your right hand and maybe blow on it or make a magical gesture. As the audience is distracted by this, take the coin in your left hand and drop it into your pocket.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Revalation</strong><br>
               Reveal that the coin is gone and show both your hands emptey!
            </li>
         </ol>
