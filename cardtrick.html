         <h3>The cross cut force</h3>
         <p>A spectator cuts the deck freely and you know what card they cut to every time<br></br>This is a very reliable <strong>card force</strong> that requires no slight of hand at all</p>
      </div>
      <div id="steps">
         <ol>
            <li><strong>Know the top card</strong><br>
               Secretly look at the top card of the deck. This is the card you will force.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Have the spectator cut the deck</strong><br>
               Ask the spectator to cut the deck anywhere they like.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Mark the cut (important!)</strong><br>
               Take the top half of the deck and place it crosswise on top of the bottom half (at a 90° angle).
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Pause and misdirect</strong><br>
               Talk for a few seconds.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Reveal the forced card</strong><br>
               Lift off the crosswise packet and ask the spectator to look at the top card of the remaining pile.
               That card is the one you peeked at in Step 1.
            </li>
         </ol>
